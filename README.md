# bottleneck
A forward genetic simulator for playing around with demographic bottlenecks

This repository contains C code for a forward-time genetic simulation program, two simple Perl scripts that provide sample values for two scenarios, a data file containing the derived allele frequency distribution for the African superpopulation in the 1000 Genomes Project, and some R code that can be used to display the results of simulations.
